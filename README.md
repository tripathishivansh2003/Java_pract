# Java Programs Collection

This repository contains a collection of basic to intermediate Java programs focusing on core concepts like exception handling, file I/O, GUI with AWT/Applet, and OOP principles such as inheritance and polymorphism. These programs were created as part of academic learning and practice.

## 📁 Files Overview

| File Name                  | Description                                                                              |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **LeapYear.java**          | Checks whether a given year is a leap year using simple conditional logic.               |
| **NoMatchException.java**  | Demonstrates user-defined exception handling when two strings do not match.              |
| **RingApplet.java**        | An AWT-based Applet that draws concentric rings (circles).                               |
| **SimpleWordCounter.java** | Counts the number of words in a given string or file input.                              |
| **StudentFile.java**       | Demonstrates file handling by writing and reading student information.                   |
| **TestShape.java**         | Implements and tests polymorphism through different shape classes (like Circle, Square). |
| **TestShopping.java**      | Simulates a simple shopping cart system with object manipulation.                        |
| **TestSuper.java**         | Demonstrates the use of `super` keyword in inheritance.                                  |
| **app\_frame.java**        | GUI-based application frame using Java AWT/Swing to demonstrate UI components.           |
| **except.java**            | Shows various types of exception handling mechanisms in Java.                            |

## 🧑‍💻 Prerequisites

* JDK 8 or higher
* Java-compatible IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse, VS Code) or CLI environment

## 🛠️ How to Run

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the terminal or your Java IDE.
3. Compile any file using:

   ```bash
   javac FileName.java
   ```
4. Run using:

   ```bash
   java ClassName
   ```

> Replace `FileName.java` and `ClassName` with the specific file and main class name you want to execute.

## 📚 Learning Outcomes

* Java exception handling
* File input/output
* Java AWT/Applet for GUI
* Object-oriented programming (OOP) principles
* Basic problem-solving using Java

## 📌 Notes

* Applet files may require a compatible viewer or browser plugin to execute.
* Some programs require input from the user or files, so ensure inputs are prepared if prompted.
